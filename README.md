## Project Overview

For this project, you will use regression modeling to analyze house sales in a northwestern county.

### The Data

This project uses the King County House Sales dataset, which can be found in  `kc_house_data.csv` in the data folder in this repo. 
The following features were ignored

* date
* view
* sqft_above
* sqft_basement
* yr_renovated
* zipcode
* lat
* long
* sqft_living15
* sqft_lot15

### Business Problem

How home renovations might increase the estimated value of their homes, and by what amount.

## Deliverables

There are three deliverables for this project:

* A **GitHub repository**
* A **Jupyter Notebook**
* A **non-technical presentation**

## Findings
The findings were that the variables that have the most impact on features were waterfront, grade and bathrooms
Bedrooms and sqft lot showed a negative correlation on price

## Recommendations
Improve the grade of the house as it will increase the price
Were possible and budget friendly adding a waterfront will guarantee increase in price
Increasing the bathrooms will also increase the price of the house
Invest in good floors as they increase the price
